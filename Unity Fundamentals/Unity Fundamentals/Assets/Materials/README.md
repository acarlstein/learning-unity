# Materials and Textures

## Materials

### Shader

A material is made of a shader which can be changed to our puposes.
By default, the "Standard" option is selected which is used for 3D rendering pipeline.

There are lots of diffferent shaders you can use.

* Nature: Useful to create terrains and "Speed Tree" elements.
* Particles: Useful for VFX and particles objects.
*  

_Note: ProBuilder also provides some extra shaders to use._

### Textures

* Albedo: It means pure color without light. (Use Diffuser Texture)

_Note: Try to stay away for renaming using the name `diffuse` since its used as a term in ligthing and shadowing._
