# Prefabs

A prefab is a game object configured inside Unity then saved out 
as an asset that can be reused multiple times in multiple scenes.

After you created your objects, drag them into this folder and it will turn into a Prefabs.

This convertion into prefab happens when droping a game object in any folder; however,
for organization purposes, we will drop them here for reuse.
